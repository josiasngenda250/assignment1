#Reflection
This assignment brought a mix of excitement and unexpected challenges. I was eager to work on it because it felt deeply personal as I was showcasing my country Rwanda so it was incredibly meaningful to me, and it gave me the chance to share an important part of my identity. One of the highlights was designing the visuals, especially the hero section, which I based on the colors of the Rwandan flag and the Canadian flag. The parallax effects added a dynamic touch to the site, and incorporating cultural elements like images of traditional dances and Imigongo art  was somthing I enjoyed doing! 

That said, not everything went smoothly. For example, making the parallax effect took me a very long time and also cleaning up the CSS was another issue i faced, my initial code was messy but reorganizing it taught me the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient structure.

There were moments of frustration too since it took me many days to finish, but those challenges made me realize how much i am learning in the class and also using the sites like W3CSS. Moving forward, I'd like to dive deeper into JavaScript.

Overall, this project was a mix of pride and struggle, It was also incredibly meaningful to work on something so personal, and Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!
